1. **Background and Color Scheme**
   - Change the overall background color to a dark theme. Ensure text and icons have sufficient contrast to remain visible.

2. **Logo Design**
   - Replace the logo icon with a more minimalistic version. Center it prominently at the top of the page.

3. **Icon and Button Layout**
   - Replace current buttons with cards that contain both an icon and text underneath. Arrange four cards in a horizontal layout, evenly spaced and centered on the screen.

4. **Typography and Text Alignment**
   - Update the font style and size to be more modern and consistent with the minimalistic theme. Ensure all text is centered within its corresponding button or card.

5. **Footer Design**
   - Redesign the footer to remove the horizontal rule and reduce its visual prominence. Ensure it has a subtle presence that doesnâ€™t distract from the main content. Adjust the spacing to be minimal and consistent with the dark theme.
