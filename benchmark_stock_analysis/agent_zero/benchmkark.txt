Agent Zero
- This run's cost $0.03773053 --> 3,8 cents
- total_tokens= 94326
- lines of code beside tool: 0
- lines of code for tool usage:  0
- execution time: (100s + 90s + 92s) / 3 = 94 seconds average
- libraries to install to make it work : cloning repo and install requirements, and docker
- tricky parts / settings to make it work /deeper knowledge and research required : work_dir usage
- what is nice: easy to use, debugs itself , saves you lots of time
- what is not so nice: not easy to install, need dockeer, costs are difficult to track, no good documentation, not scalable, results are not very consistent
- ease of use : easy
- summary: interesting approach but not really an agentic framework
