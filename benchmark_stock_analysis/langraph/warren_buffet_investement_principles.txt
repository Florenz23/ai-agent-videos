Value investing: Buffett looks for undervalued companies - those trading below their intrinsic value. He aims to buy great businesses at fair prices, rather than fair businesses at great prices.
Long-term perspective: He invests with a long-term outlook, often holding stocks for decades. This aligns with his belief that the stock market is unpredictable in the short term but tends to rise over the long term.
Understanding the business: Buffett only invests in companies and industries he thoroughly understands. This principle helps him better assess the company's potential and risks.
Competitive advantage: He looks for companies with a strong "economic moat" - a sustainable competitive advantage that protects the company from competitors.
Quality management: Buffett places high importance on honest, competent management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders.
Financial health: He prefers companies with strong balance sheets, consistent earnings, high return on equity, and low debt.
Predictable earnings: Buffett favors businesses with steady and predictable earnings rather than those in volatile or cyclical industries.
Margin of safety: He always aims to buy stocks with a significant margin of safety - the difference between the intrinsic value of a stock and its market price.
Dividend policy: While not a strict requirement, Buffett often favors companies that pay dividends and have a history of increasing them.
Circle of competence: He sticks to investments within his "circle of competence" - areas where he has deep knowledge and expertise.
